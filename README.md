# 📉 US Tech Layoffs Analysis (2020-2025)

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of my journey into Data Analytics, i analyzed real-world workforce data to understand the scale of the economic downturn in the technology sector. This project specifically isolates the **United States market**, tracking layoff events from early 2020 through December 2025.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **Scope:** Analyzed **1,703 distinct layoff events** within the US.
* **Timeline:** The dataset covers a 5-year span, confirming that workforce reduction is a long-term structural shift rather than a temporary anomaly.
* **Recent Trends:** The data captures significant enterprise-level restructuring continuing into Q4 2025 (HP, Amazon, etc...).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Core logic and data manipulation.
* **Pandas:** ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data cleaning.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development and documentation.
* **PowerBI:** Data Visualization.
